# Hello-world
Data visualization is an vital skill this is utilized in many parts of the statistics analysis method.

Exploratory data visualization commonly happens for the duration of and after the facts wrangling process, and is the main technique that you'll use to recognize the patterns and relationships present in your records. This know-how will help you technique any statistical analyses and will assist you construct conclusions and findings. This process can also light up additional data cleaning duties to be performed.

Explanatory records visualization techniques are used after producing your findings, and are used to assist talk your consequences to others. Understanding design issues will make sure that your message is apparent and effective. In addition to being an excellent manufacturer of visualizations, going thru this project will additionally assist you be a terrific consumer of visualizations which might be offered to you through others.


Project Details
Dataset: Ford GoBike
Explore the facts: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.
Document the story: organized findings carry a story to offer to an audience.
Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is ready for a curious audience.
Project Findings
This project is a win - win situation where a large quantity of humans can advantage from this program:

Environmentally friendly, budget friendly, and lifetsyle friendly.
Subscribers (i.E. each day commuters) advantage from a health commuting choice.
Customers (i.E. travelers, students, etc.) have a sustainable, but flexible alternative for journeying the city.
Affordable and handy transportation for the human beings of all socioeconomic classes.
Renting a motorbike from theFord GoBike System is a fantastic (wholesome and environmentally friendly) way of moving around inside the city, each for leisure and work.
There are two varieties of customers the use of the device: Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers are primarily daily commuters, having quick journeys to and from work, who lease a motorcycle on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm. Customers are generally tourists or occassional riders who use the device especially on weekends to explore the Bay Area. Age is likewise a aspect inside consumer type. Subscribers who fall inside the age institution between 26-35 years vintage are the most commonplace age institution to apply the motorbike sharing machine. The 26-35 years vintage also lead the spike which happens throughout all age groups in October. Subscribers who fall within the 36-forty five year old age group are the following most common age organization to apply the motorcycle sharing machine, and comply with a similar trend on the 26-35 yr olds.

readme.Md - This Markdown report includes sections which you should fill out as you pick out your dataset, whole your exploration, and plan your explanatory analysis.

Exploration_template.Ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook consists of segment templates to help you arrange your exploration, starting from loading inside the statistics, working thru univariate visualizations, and ending with bivariate and multivariate exploration.

Slide_deck_template.Ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains starter cells to help you prepare your slide deck deliverable. These cells offer an example of ways the slide deck have to be organized, along with pre-set slideshow settings.

To view the slide deck, you will need to use the [removed]all one line): jupyter nbconvert Example_Project_Diamonds_Part2.Ipynb --to slides --publish serve --template output_toggle

output_toggle.Tpl - This template record may be used with nbconvert to export your slide deck. This adds extra functionality to the slide deck via hiding the code to start, simplest making it seen if the reader clicks on the output (which should commonly be visualizations within the case of this venture).
